    <h5 style={{color:"white", paddingLeft:"10px",width:"900px", wordWrap: "break-word"}}>For us, doing good is just as if not more important than doing well. Our employees are encouraged to engage in charitable giving and volunteer programs like LinkedIn Coaches, which has helped empower over 1.2M+ job seekers facing barriers to grow their careers and expand their networks through career coaching and mentorship. We also provide employees with a donation match benefit of up to $15K through our matching gifts program. To date, weâ€™ve made $500K in corporate donations to the National Urban League, Southern Poverty Law Center, NAACP, the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, and others who work on advocacy and economic justice for the Black community.
